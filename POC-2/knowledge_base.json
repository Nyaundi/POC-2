rev006c\nminimum 075 \ntimes tunnel \u00f8\nbarycentre\nl 1\nl 2a binstallation requisites\nthe tunnel\n the position of the tunnel will depend on the interior and exterior shape of the boats bow .\n  optimal positioning of the tunnel will be in the bow and as low as possible\n at least 0.75 times the tunnel diameter from the \nwaterline. \n to avoid cavitation in the propeller the tunnel \nmust be positioned as low as possible. the lever effect in the boat is proportional to the increase of the distance l1 and l2 between the barycentre and the position of the tunnel a and b.\n an increase in the length of the tunnel increases the effect of the loss of charge decreasing the nominal driving force.\n to limit losing charge the optimal length is equal to 34 times the tube diameter a ratio of up to 6 can be tolerated.ffor greater lever effect prefer position b to position a.\nsingol propeller double propeller18\nen\nbow thruster btq140  btq185  it en  rev006cinstallation\n the rounded ends of the tunnel limit the creation of turbulences and cavitations improving performance of the propeller thrust \nand reducing noise levels to a minimum.\n the force produced by the flow of the water when the boat is moving produces resistance on the rear face of the tunnel which is an area exposed frontally to the water flow. to limit this phenomenon prepare an indentation in the rear part of the tunnel. otherwise create a deflector on the front part of the tunnel.\n if the tunnel is near the waterline it is advisable to fit a grating at the end of the tube. the grating must have as large a vertical mesh as possible to avoid contrasting the propeller thrust. the vertical mesh prevents the entry of most of the floating objects.singol propeller\ndouble propeller19\ninstallationen\nbow

table below so that the propeller is \npositioned exactly half way along the internal length of the tunnel.\n use the flange to mark the centre of the holes on the tube.\n fix the drilling template on the reference points making \nsure they are aligned with precision at the halfway point of the tube.n.b. all holes must be exactly aligned with the halfway point of the tunnel since tolerance between propeller and tunnel is minimal.\n take care that there are no resin residues in the contact \narea between flange and tube this could cause misalign \nment. any resin residues and any other hindrance to correct contact must be removed by sandpaper\n. the thruster can be installed at any angle within 90 from vertical. if the electric motor is positioned of necessity at an angle of more than 30 from vertical a special support must be constructed.\n1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101 0 2 3 4 1 0 2 3 4btq14        60 mm\nbtq18        80 mm\n insert two orings into the special seats inside the flange.1 0 2 3 4

thismanual.\n1. to add water to the toilet beforeusing raise flush lever until desiredwater level is reached.  generally morewater is required only when flushingsolids.2. to flush toilet press flush lever\nsharply down to the floor until contentsclear bowl. a sharp popping noise isnormal when the vacuum seal is broken and flushing action begins. be sureto hold lever down for three 3 seconds. if flush lever is accidentally released before waste clears bowl do notattempt to flush toilet again untilvacuum pump stops running. a smallamount of water should remain in the\nbowl after flushing.3. do not dispose of sanitary napkins\nor other nondissolving items in toiletsuch as facial tissue or paper towels.these items can cause plugging of thesystem. refer to the deodorants andspecial tissue section in this manualfor more information.\nall boats with fixed toilets in u.s. waters and in the waters of some other countries are required to be equippedwith an operable marine sanitation device msd.  the vacuflush system is a holding tank or type iii system asdefined by the u.s. coast guard.\ntype iii systems are designed to permit operation of the toilet without the direct discharge of untreated waste\nafter every flush.  this means onboard toilet facilities can be used when the boat is near swimmers beaches orshellfish beds.\ntype iii systems can be discharged at marina dockside pumpout stations or if in coastal waters a minimum of\nthree miles offshore.  overboard discharge capability must remain secured while within the threemile\nlimit.  the overboard discharge pump is activated by a keyed switch located in the toilet compartment.  this key\nshould be removed at all times except when discharge pump is operating.\nfederal legislation has provided grants to private marinas to install dockside pumps especially in coastal water.\nit is estimated that over 3500 pumpout stations in total will be added due to this legislation.\nsewage from any source should not be discharged directly into our waters.  if you are interested in learning more\nabout this issue please contact sealand at the phone number or address listed on the back page of this manual.request clean water notebook volumes 1 and 2.\nnormal operation4\n key system components\nvacuum toilet  the vacuflush toilet operates in a way different from other marine toilets.  vacuflush systems use\na small amount of water a little more than a pint or .5 liter per flush in addition to a simple vacuum.  the toilet isconnected to a pressurized freshwater system.  fresh water is the key to an odorfree bathroom compartment.\nvacuflush toilets are equipped with an integral vacuum breaker which prevents the possible contamination of thepotable water supply.\nvacuum tank  the vacuum tank stores vacuum energy.  system vacuum level is monitored by a vacuum switch\nlocated on the vacuum tank.  when this switch senses a drop in vacuum in the system it automatically signals thepump to energize and bring the vacuum to operating level.  this process is normally completed in less than oneminute.  in a properly operating system the stored vacuum will slowly dissipate between flushes permitting thevacuum pump to quickly renew the vacuum.\nvacuum pump  the vacuum pump is an electric straightthrough bellows type.  it is manufactured of longlasting\npolypropylene and draws only 4 to 6 amps of current at 12 vdc.  this unique pump design is both an efficient air andliquid pump that handles solids without a problem.  it has two duckbill valves on each side of the pump chamber toprevent backflow of waste and vacuum.\nvacuum generator  the vacuum generator combines the vacuum tank and vacuum pump in one unit.\nit greatly reduces installation time and eliminates the hose run between the tank and pump.  its compact size makesit especially wellsuited to smaller crafts.\nholding tanks  holding tanks from dometic are made of superstrong 38 9.5mm thick polyethylene  50\nthicker than most other holding tanks.  each unit has a solid onepiece construction with no seams for unmatcheddurability.  tanks come in several capacities and shapes.  contact dometic for details.  a deodorant additive isrequired to keep the holding tank odorfree.  see deodorants and special tissue section for further information.\ntankwatch\n level indicator  the tankwatch unit utilizes microfloat switches which activate an indicator panel.\nthe inspection cap in the holding tank contains the microfloat switch units.  the adjustable probe assemblies areflexible polybutylene tubing and are designed to flex when tank contents move.\ninline vent filter  our sanigard\ntm vent filter has special odorremoving filter materials to help keep your boat\nsmelling clean and pleasant.  heavierthanair malodors accumulate in the holding tank. the sanigard vent filter hasa special type of activated filter media to remove these odors before they offend. each cartridge is good for an entireseason and is easily replaced for a fresh start.  replacement cartridges are available from your local marine dealer.\ndockside discharge deck fitting  the holding tank is connected to a deck discharge fitting.  this fitting in turn can\nbe connected to a dockside pump which may have a rubber coneshaped nozzle or a cam lock fitting.  refer toaccessories section for further information on the nozall fitting which makes using a dockside pump easy andconvenient.\ndischarge pump  our tseries sanipump\ntm discharge pump can run dry without harm and draws just 6 amps at 12\nvdc.  the discharge pump has a flow rate of just over 5.25 gallons per minute 11.4 liters per minute.  emptying anonboard tank usually takes four to six minutes.  the tpump is connected to a throughhull fitting.  check the sectionon marine sanitation regulations for information on areas where discharge is allowed.5 system start up\n1. turn on inlet water supply.\n2. turn on electrical power to system.3. flush water into system by depressing flush lever until water starts flowing to the vacuum pump approxi\nmately 15 seconds. the vacuum pump will run for approximately 60 to 90 seconds until system reachesoperating vacuum level and then will shut off.\n winterizing\nat the end of each season the sealand toilet should be winterized forstorage by either draining or using potable watersafe antifreeze in thesystem.\nto drain\n1. thoroughly flush system with fresh water.2. empty holding tank.3. shut off water supply to toilets and remove inlet waterline fig. c.\ndo not remove brass cap on bottom of valve.\n4. press flush lever until all water is drained from toilets.\nto use antifreeze\n1. drain potable water tank.2. add freshwater antifreeze to potable water tank.3. flush potable water antifreeze and water mixture through toilets and into the waste holding tank. each\ninstallation is different so amounts may vary.  user discretion is required to assure adequate protection.\n4. empty holding tank.\nnote   use nontoxic antifreeze designated for potable water systems.  see vehicle owners manual.\ncaution  never use automotivetype antifreeze in freshwater systems.the sealand toilet should be cleaned regularly for maximum sanitation and\noperational efficiency. you can clean it just as you would a household toilet.do not use caustic chemicals such as drainopening types as theywill damage the seals.\nbowl cleaning  for stubborn stains use sealand\n bowl and seal\ncleaner fig. a. its manufactured especially for use with sealand toilets.in certain locations where water is hard a buildup of lime may dull the toiletbowl finish. restore the shine with this sealand cleaner. if you cannot findit in your area contact sealand for your nearest dealer. if the cleaner is notavailable you can also use bar keepers friend\n cleanser. it is not neces\nsary to vigorously scrub with either product. please follow label instruc\ntions.\nseal cleaning  after an extended time mineral deposits from hard\nwater can build up under the edge of the rubber bowl seal resulting in aslow leakdown of water from the bowl. to prevent this mineral buildup\nperiodically clean under the bowl seal with sealand bowl and seal cleaner\nfig. b.\n1. shut off water supply.\n2. apply cleaner onto the seal cleaning tool supplied with new toilet open\nthe flush ball by pressing on flush lever and scrub under the seal. make\nsure to push bristles between bottom of seal and top of flush ball\nsurface to scrub all parts of seal that come into contact with flush ball.\n3. close ball and wait 23 minutes.4. open flush

number\n0000008\n deodorants and special tissue\nyour vacuflush sanitation system requires the regular addition of a deodorant product to reduce malodors and\nto help break down holding tank contents.  several factors should be considered in selecting a deodorantproduct.\nliquid or granulated  liquid products obviously work more quickly by readily going into solution.  granulated\npowder formulations on the other hand have the advantage of requiring less storage space and are less likelyto leak if the package is inadvertently damaged.\nformaldehyde versus nonformaldehyde  dometic manufactures both types of deodorants.  generally\nspeaking formaldehyde formulas control odor very effectively at all temperatures and with all degrees of waterhardness.  sealand\n environmentfriendly brand which is formaldehyde free is similarly effective.\nenvironmental hazards  if you would like further information on the impact of holding tank deodorants call or\nwrite dometic at the number and address listed on the back page of this manual.  request a copy of cleanwater notebook volume 5 which provides complete information in this regard.\nhow much deodorant and how to add it  the deodorant is added directly into the toilet bowl then flushed\ninto the holding tank. follow bottle or package instructions. conditions of extremely warm weather longerwaste holding time and larger tank capacities may require more deodorant treatment.  also to maintain optimum efficiency in odor control the waste holding tank should be cleaned thoroughly at least once or more eachseason depending on use.\nwhy not use household toilet paper in your sealand toilet .  household tissues often contain adhesives\nwhich bond together the paper fibers from which the tissue is made. the adhesives prevent the tissue frombreaking apart and their use in ultralow flow systems can cause system clogging.  sealand tissue is especially designed for use in low water toilet systems.  its rapid dissolving properties minimize the amount ofresidual paper in the holding tank and allow deodorizers to work more efficiently.\nsealand versus other brands  dometic constantly strives to provide our system owners with effective\nproducts that have minimal environmental impact and good value.  many other deodorant products do notmeasure up to our standards of performance and

inidentifying the location of vacuum leaks.  thevacuum tester consists of a vacuum gauge and aconeshaped plug.  inserting the plug in the inlet ofthe vacuum tank or generator isolates the toilet fromthe system.  in this way a troublesome leak caneasily be located in either system.\norder only the vacuum tester part number\n530002 or as part of the complete system maintenance kit part number 310228.\n service tip\nchecking for water leaks behind or under toilets or other appliances can make it difficult to locate the source.dripping water at room temperature makes it difficult to feel wetness.  taking four or five sheets of toilet tissueand wiping all seams and waterline connections offers a simple means of locating the general area of the leakage.  start at the top of the unit since gravity will cause a leak to run downward.  when the tissue comes incontact with the leaking water it will immediately change texture.\nvacuum tester\nvacuflush\nstatus panelvacustat indicator

kaptitelchapter 2 general instructions and regulations 28.7.172.5.1.1  protective conductor and potential equalisation\nelectric current below 50 v may be lifethreatening. fort this reason systems are grounded with a protective\nconductor. in connection with a rcd the current supply will be disconnected in case of a failure.\nappropriate safety precautions like the rcd and corresponding fuses have to be provided by the customer\nto guarantee a save operation of the generator. \n2.5.1.2  protective conductor for panda ac generators\nthe generator is earthed as a standard centre and ground are interconnected in the generator\nterminal box by a shunt. this is a basic firstle vel safety measure which offers protection as long\nas no other measures are installed. above all it  is designed for delivery and a possible test run.\nthis neutralisation pro tective earthing neutral  pen is only ef fective if all parts of the electrical\nsystem are jointly earthed to a common potential.  the shunt can be removed if this is necessary\nfor technical reasons and another protective system has been set up instead.\nwhile the generator is being operated the full voltage is applied to the ac control box as\nwell. therefore it is essential to ensure that the control box is closed and secured againsttouch while the generator is running.\nthe battery must always be disconnected if work on the generator or electrical system is to\nbe carried out so that the generator cannot be started up unintentionally.\n2.5.1.3  switch off all loads while working on the generator\nall loads must be disconnected prior to working on the gen erator to avoid damage to the devices. in addition the\nsemiconductor relays in the ac control box must be disconn ected in order to avoid the booster capacitors being\nactivated during setup. the negative termi nal of the battery must be disconnected.\ncapacitors are required to run the generator. these have two varying functionsa the working capacitorsb the booster capacitorsboth groups are located in a separate ac control box.capacitors store electrical energy. high voltages may rema in across the capacitor contacts even after they have\nbeen disconnected from the mains. as a safety precaution  do not touch the contacts. if the capacitors must be\nreplaced or inspected the contacts shall be shortcircui ted by connecting an electrical conductor to discharge\npotentially remaining potential differences.\nif the generator is switched off normally the working capa citors are automatically discharged via the winding of the\ngenerator. the booster capacitors are discharg ed by means of internal discharge resistors.\nfor safety reasons all capacitors mu st be discharged through shortcircuiting  before work is carried

system\ntips regarding starter batteryfischer panda recommends normal starter battery use. if a genset is required for extreme winter conditions then\nthe starter battery capacity should be doubled. it is recommended that the starter battery be regularly charged by asuitable batterycharging device i.e. at least every 2 mont hs. a correctly charged starter battery is necessary for\nlow temperatures.\n5.3.1  daily routine checks before starting\n1. oil level control ideal level max.\nattention  oil pressure control true the diesel motor automatically switches off when \nthere is a lack of oil but it  is very damaging for the \nmotor if the oil level drops to  the lowest limit. air can be \nsucked in suddenly when the boat rocks in heavy seas if the oil level is at a minimum. this affects the grease in the bearings. it is therefore necessary to check the oil level daily before in itially running the generator. the oil \nlevel must be topped up to  the maximum level if the \nlevel drops below the mark between maximum und minimum levels.\n2. state of cooling water.\nthe panda generator\nseitepage 46      kaptitelchapter 5 the panda generator 28.7.17the external compensation tank should be filled up to a maximum of in a co ld state. it is very important that large\nexpansion area remains above the cooling water level.\n3. open sea cock for cooling water intake.\nfor safety reasons the seacock must be closed after the generator\nhas been switched off. it should be reopened before starting the generator.\n4. check raw water filter.\nthe raw water  filter must be regularly checked and cleaned. the impeller fatigue increases if residual affects the\nraw water  intake.\n5. check all hose connections and hose clamps are \nleakage.\nleaks at hose connections must be immediately repaired es pecially the raw water  impeller pump. it is certainly\npossible that the raw water  impeller pump will produce leak s depending upon the situation. this can be caused\nby sand particles in the raw water  etc. in this case immediately exchange the pump because the dripping\nwater will be sprayed by the belt pulley into the soun d insulated casing and ca n quickly cause corrosion.\n6. check all electrical lead terminal contacts are firm.\nthis is especially the case with the temperature switch contacts which autom atically switch of f the generator in\ncase of faults. there is on ly safety if these systems are regularly checked and these systems will protect the\ngenerator when there is a fault.\n7. check the motor and generator mounting screws are \ntight.\nthe mounting screws must be checked regularly to ensure  the generator is safe. a vi sual check of these screws\nmust be made when the oil level is checked.\n8. switch the land electricity generator switch to zero \nbefore starting or switch off all the load.\nthe generator should only be started when all the load have been switched off. the e xcitation of the generator\nwill be suppressed if the generator is switched off with load co nnected left for a while or switched on with extra\nload thus reducing the residual magnetism necessary for excitation of the generator to a minimum. in certain\ncircumstances this can lead to the generator being reexcitated by means of a dc source. if the generator doesnot excitate itself when starti ng then excitation by means of dc must be carried out again.\n9. check the automatic controls functions and oil \npressure.\nremoving a cable end from the monitoring switch carr ies out this control test. the generator should then\nautomatically switch off. please adhere to the insp ection timetable see checklist in the appendix.\n5.3.2  starting generator\nsee the manual of the electric al control and operation

drained and then filled \nwith cold weather fluids always run the generator for 10 minutes to ensure the new fuel is present throughout the system.\n6.3.1.2  tips regarding starter battery\nfischer panda recommends normal starter battery use. if an  genset is required for extreme winter conditions then\nthe starter battery capacity should be doubled. it is re commended that the starter battery be regularly charged by a\nsuitable batterycharging device i.e. at least every 2 mo nths. a correctly charged starter battery is necessary for\nlow temperatures.\n6.3.2  light load oper ation and engine idle\nif an engine is operated on a load less than 2530  of its rated output  the soot of the generator will be observed\nwhich may give cause for concern. the usual results of this operation are heavier t han normal lubricating oil\nconsumption and oil leaks from the air and exhaust manifo lds. this condition is part icularly evident on standby\ngenerator set applications.\n6.3.2.1  the soot of the genera tor is due to the fact that\nthe cylinder temperatures are too low to ensure complete burning of all the fuel delivered.\na further result is that of abnormal carbon buildup on the valves piston crowns and exha ust ports. fuel dilution of\nthe lubricating oil will also occur.\n6.3.2.2  to prevent the soot of the gene rator following steps should be observed\nrunning on light load should be avoide d or reduced to the minimum period. \nin a period of 50 operation hours the engine or generator se t should be run on full load for four hours to burn off\naccumulations of carbon in the engine and exhaust system. this may require the use of a dummy load. the loadshould be built up gradually from 30  to 100  within 3 hours and hold at 100  for one hour.\n6.3.3  generator load for a longer period and overload\nensure the generator is not overloaded. overloading occurs when the electrical load is higher than the generator\ncan provide. if this occur for a longer period the engine may be damaged. overloading may cause rough runninghigh oil and fuel consumption increased emissions.\nfor a long engine life the long therm load should not exceed 80  of the nominal load. long therm load is the load\nover several hours. it is harmless for the generator to deliver full nominal power for 23 hours.\nthe hole conception of the fischer panda generator make sure that the full power operation at extreme condition\nwill not increase th e engine temperatures over. please note that the emissions of the generator also increase at full\npower operation.generator operation

resonance vibrations\nbecause of airborne sounds. if this should be unavoidable then it is recommended that this surface is lined with\n1 mm lead foil which will change th e mass and the vibration behaviour.\nyou should avoid fixing the generator on a s lippery surface with little mass i.e. pl ywood. this acts as an amplifier of\nairborne sounds in the most unreasonable case. an impr ovement can be achieved by  reinforcing these surfaces\nwith ribs. in addition the breakthroughs which interrupt  these surfaces should be sawed off. the lining of the\nsurrounding walls with a heavy layer

inlet and should not be connected to any other engine\nsystems. ensure that the following insta llation instructions are complied with\n7.4.2  installation of the through hull fitting in yachts  scheme\nfig. 7.4.21 position of the through hull fitting it is good practice for yachts to use a through hull fitting \nwith an integrated strainer. the through hull fitting raw water intake is often mo unted against the sailing \ndirection to induce more water intake for cooling. \nfor panda generators the through hull inlet should not \npoint in the sailing direction when sailing at hi gher speeds \nmore water will be forced into the inlet than the pump can \nhandle and your generator will flood.\n7.4.3  quality of the ra w water sucking in line\nin order to keep the suction resistance in the line at a mi nimum the raw water intake system must have an inner\ndiameter of at least 1 25 mm. \nthis applies also to installation components such as throughhull fitting sea cock raw water filter etc.the intake suction line should be kept as short as possibl e. install the raw water inle t in close proximity to the\ngenset.\nafter startup the cooling water quantity must be measured e.g. by catching at the exhaust. for the flow\n1\n2\n1 external cooling water expansion tank\n2 external ventilation valveexample  see section 5.2 for detailed informationinstallation

equipped with a water intake pump mounted on the motor. since the intake pump is an impeller pump\nthere are wearing parts which are likely to require replacement after a period of time. ensure that the genset isinstalled so that the intake pump can be easily accessed.  if this is not possible an external intake pump could be\ninstalled in an easily accessible location\nif the generator is installed above the waterline it is po ssible that the impeller will we ar out faster because after\nstarting the pump runs dry for some seconds. the raw water hose should form a loop as near as possible to the rawwater inlet of the generator see picture below. this en sures the pump only sucks in air for a short time. the\nimpeller pump will be lubricated by raw wa ter and the impeller life span will be in creased.with the installation of a\nnon return valve in the raw water in let line which is under the waterline this problem can be restricted.\nwhen starting the generator you should always consider when raw water runs out of the exhaust system. if this\ntakes longer than 5 seconds you should replace the impeller pump because it sucks in air for too long before itdelivers raw water. the impeller has lo st its effect and cannot suck in raw water anymore. this results to an\noverheating of the motor. if the impeller is not exchang ed early enough the impeller blades may break into pieces\nand plugging the cooling water cycle. it is very import ant to exchange the impeller after a couple of months. \nnote if the raw water line is too lo ng for the impeller pump or the \ngenerator installed too high above the water line a electrical pump can be installed into the ra w water line. in this case the \nimpeller should be removed out of the impeller pump. \ncontact fischer panda for further information.\nnote never change the impeller for many years without \nexchanging the old pump. if the sealing ring is defective within the pump raw water runs into the sound cover of the genset. a repair is then very expensive. \nreplacement impeller and also a spare pump should always \nbe on board. the old pump can be sent back to fischer panda for costeffective repair.

\npossible heeling must be taken into consideratio n if installed \nat the midship line the water hose for the external vent valve is located at the back of the sound insulated capsule. this hose is split in the middle and extended respectively at each end by an additional hose and a connecting nipple. both hose ends must be led outside of the sound cover if possible 600 mm over the water line in the midship line. the \nvalve is connected at the highest place to the two hose ends. if the valve jams the cool wa ter line cannot be deaerated \nafter stopping the generator the water column is not discontinued and water can penetrate into the combustion chamber of the engine . this will lead to da mage the engine in \na short term\ninstallation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7

installation of the standard exhaust system\nthe generator exhaust system must remain completely in dependent and separate from the exhaust system of any\nother units on board. the water lock must be installed at  the lowest point of the exhaust system. an optional noise\ninsulated water lock can also be installed. the exhaust ho se descends from the capsule to the water lock. then the\nhose rises via the goose neck to the silencer see drawing. the goose neck must be vertical and sit preferablyalong the ships keel centre line. in order that the back pres sure inside the exhaust is not to high the total length of\nthe exhaust system should not exceed 63 m.\nby injecting the outlet raw water into the exhaust manifold the exhaust gases are cooled and the noise emissions\nfrom the exhaust system are reduced. \nfig. 7.5.11 installation scheme standard exhaust system\n7.6 .installation of the waterlock\nnote pay attention to the right flow direction throught the \nwaterlock. \nunfortunately it can occasionally occu r that because of an disadvantageous mounting position of the waterlock sea\nwater gets into the diesel engines combustion chamber. this disables the diesel engine by irreversible damages.\nquite frequently this leads to discussions during which th e parties involved in the yachts construction or the\ninstallation of the generator have to explain themselves.\none point in this situation can be clarified definitely\nif sea water gets into the inner section of the engine th is is not possible due to constructional defects of the\ngenerator or to malfunctions on the engine itself. it ca n only reach the combustion chamber via the exhaust hose\nand thus get into the engine.\ninstallation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7 installation instructions      seitepage 59thereby the position of the generator and the waterlo ck as well as the arrangement of the cooling water and\nexhaust hoses play the decisive role. \nif the waterlock is arranged in an unfavourable position the cooling water flowing back in the exhaust hose can rise\nso high that it reaches the exhaust stack. since at leas t one discharge valve is always open when the engine is shut\noff the sea water has free access to th e combustion chamber. by capillary acti on this sea water then flows past the\ncocks and even reaches the engine oil in that way. in fact a surprisingly high oil level is a first indication of an\nupcoming catastrophe.\nif an usual high oil level can be detected andor the oil is of a greyish colour the engine must not be used\nanymore. this is a certain sign for cooling water that got into the oil pan. if the engine is started under these\nconditions the water and the oil are mixed into an emul sion. the oil will quickly become so viscous that one\nwill have to call it a paste. in this phase the fine oil hoses are blocked and a few moments later the machinegets destroyed because of insufficient lubrication. before this happens an immediate oil change should bemade.  since the water can only reach the engine via the combustion chamber it can be assumed that thecompression rings will start to corrode. these effects have to be discussed with an engine expert. it willcertainly be reasonable to immediately inject plenty penetrating oil through the intake stack and to slowlyturn the engine with the starter motor. \nthe cooling water can reach the exhaust area via the exhaust hose as well as via the cooling water feed.\n7.6.1  possible cause for wa ter in the exhaust hose\n7.6.1.1  possible cause exhaust hose\nif the cause is the exhaust hose itself the following points are to be checked at the hose\na position of the waterlock is too high. the water reaches the exhaust hose.b position of the waterlock is too far away from the midd le of the generator. the water reaches the exhaust hose in\ntilted position.\nc the waterlock is too small relating to the length of the exhaust hose.\n7.6.1.2  possible cause cooling water hose\nif the generator is not clearly installed 600 mm over the water line the cooling water feed must be equipped with a\nventing valve which is at least led out 600 mm over the water line. this position must also be assured in every\ntilted position. therefore the venting valve should be located in  the ships center line so th at it cannot move in tilted\nposition.\na position of the venting valve is too low. the water flows into the exhaust area when the ship is tilted.\nb position of the venting valve is too far from the ships center line. the water reaches the exhaust area when the\nship is tilted.\nc the venting valve does not work because it jams or it is clotted. the venting valves function needs to be\nchecked regularly.\nas it consistently happens that functioning risks are no t realised during the laying of the exhaust hose the following\nexplanations refer explicitly to the ex haust hose. here the location the size and the position of the waterlock play\na very decisive role\n7.6.2  installation area  of the waterlock\nconcerning a watercooled exhaust system it must be regarded that  under no circumstances  cooling water from\nthe exhaust hose can get into the exha ust elbow area at the engine. if this happens the cooling water can get into\nthe combustion chamber via an open discharge valve. this would lead to irreparable damage at the engine.\nin addition to that one has to reckon with possible tilted positions of sa iling yachts which makes the position of the\nwaterlock even more important. in general one could say thatinstallation instructions\nseitepage 60      kaptitelchapter 7 installation instructions 28.7.17the deeper the waterlock is located underneath the generator  the better the protection from entering water into the\ncombustion chamber.\nthe picture below shows that the distance between the critical point at the exhaust elbow and the maximum\npermissible water level in the exhaust hose is stated with 600 mm. this distance should be understood as a\nminimum distance.\n7.6.3  the volume of the waterlock\nthe waterlock must be measured so large  that it can take the entire amount of  water flowing back from the exhaust\nhose. the amount of water depends on the hoses length l and its cross section. while the diesel engine is\nrunning cooling water is continuously injected into the exhaust system and is carted outside with the emissions by\nthe exhaust gas pressure. when the engine is turned off th e number of revolutions sinks quite fast. by doing so the\npoint is reached where the exhaust gas pressure does not suffice anymore to cart the cooling water out. all coolingwater remaining in the hose at that point flows back into the waterlock. at the same time the diesel engine itself\ncontinues to cart cooling water through the cooling water pump as long as it keeps on rotating.\nthe waterlock must necessarily be measured large enough that it can take the entire amount of cooling\nwater and at the same time does not exceed the prescribed vertical height of 600 mm up to the criticalpoint at the exhaust elbow.\nfig. 7.6.3.01 volume of the waterlock\nfig. 7.6.3.02 testing the cooling water level if there are any doubts a verification can easily be made \nby temporarily using a clearsighted hose 1 as exhaust hose. in that way the cooling water level can be checked very easily.\n7.6.3.1  ideal position of the waterlock\nimportant note the ideal position of the waterlock would be in center \nunderneath the generator. \nonly in this position it is assu red that the water level cannot \nchange drastically in tilted posi tion by the waterlock moving \nout of the center line. \nsee the following pictures\n1installation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7 installation instructions      seitepage 61fig. 7.6.3.11 ideal position of the waterlock in fig. 7.6.3.11 the waterlock is mounted in center \nunderneath the generator. \nwhen the ship tilts the position of the waterlock related to the \ncritical point at the exhaust hose changes only slightly.\nfig. 7.6.3.12 tilted position 15 degrees tilted position 15 degrees  fig. 7.6.3.12\nthe distance from the exhaust elbow to the hydrostatic head \nhas derated to 540 mm.\nfig. 7.6.3.13 tilted position 30 degrees tilted position 30 degrees  fig. 7.6.3.13\nthe distance of the water level even in ideal position \nchanges that only 458 mm distance remain. so the critical distance is underrun already. \nfig. 7.6.3.14 tilted position 45 degrees tilted position 45 degrees  fig. 7.6.3.14\nin this case the water level rise so high that the distance \nconstitutes only 325 mm.\neven when the water lock is mounted in the ideal spot at an \nextremely tilted position of 45 degrees there is still the risk that water can get straight into the discharge stack area through strong rocking motions sloshing. this shows that the distance of 600 mm represen ts a minimum size at which \neven when installed ideally the water can slosh into the \nexhaust elbow when the ship is very tilted or rocks very hard.\ninstallation instructions\nseitepage 62      kaptitelchapter 7 installation instructions 28.7.17summary\nthe preset minimum height of 600 mm must be regarded un conditionally and is only valid if the waterlock is\nmounted in its ideal position in center underneath the gener ator. a higher position is highly recommended if it has to\nbe reckoned with tilted positions of 45 degrees.\n7.6.3.2  example of the installation of the waterlock offcenter and possible effects\nthe following pictures are prim arily relevant for an installation of the generator with the wate rlock on sailing yachts.\na change in the mounting position caused  by tilted position does not have to  be reckoned concerning motor yachts.\nhere it is only necessary to regard that the volume of the waterlock is measured so large that it can take the entire\namount of water flowing back and at the same time maintains the minimum distance of 600 mm.\na installation of the waterlock 500 mm next to the generators center line\nfig. 7.6.3.21 waterlock 500 mm next to the center line installation of the waterlock 500 mm next to the \ngenerators center line\nfig. 7.6.3.22 tilted position 45 degrees tilted position 45 degrees  fig. 7.6.3.22\nthe water level is now at the sa me height as the critical point \nat the exhaust elbow. if the ship is sailed in a tilted position of \n45 degrees with an installation like this the ingress of cooling \nwater into the combustion cham ber is inevitable. irreparable \ndamages are preprogrammed.\ninstallation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7 installation instructions      seitepage 63b installation distance between waterlock and the generators center line 1000 mm\nfig. 7.6.3.23 waterlock 1000 mm next to center line installation distance between waterlock and the \ngenerators center line 1000 mm\nfig. 7.6.3.24 tilted position 30 degrees tilted position 30 degrees  fig. 7.6.3.24\nthe water level and the critical point at the exhaust elbow are \nat the same level now. if the ship  is sailed in a tilted position \nof 30 degrees with an installation  like that the infiltration of \ncooling water into the combustion chamber is inevitable. irreparable damages are preprogrammed.\nsummary\nconcerning sailing yachts it must be re garded that the waterlock is mounted in  center underneath the generator at\nleast in reference to the ships center line. thus the wate rlock is prevented from leaki ng very strongly when the\nship is tilted.\nthe leaking of the waterlock leads to a rise of the wate r level which then gets too close to the exhaust elbows\ncritical point.\n7.7 exhaust  water separator\nin order to reduce the noise level of the generator unit to a minimum an optional exhaust outlet muffler can be\nmounted next to the throughhull fitting. additionally ther e is a component at fischer panda which acts as both an\nexhaust goose neck and water separator. with this exhaustwater separator the cooling water is derived over aseparate pipe. the exhaust noises emanating from the exteri or of the yacht are strongly decreased. particularly the\nwater splash.\ninstallation instructions\nseitepage 64      kaptitelchapter 7 installation instructions 28.7.17fig. 7.7.01 installation scheme exhaust  water separator\n7.8 installation exhaust water separator\nif the exhaust water separator was sufficiently highly installed a goose neck is no longer necessary. the exhaust\nwater separator fulfils the same function. if the super s ilent exhaust system were installed correctly the generator\nwill not disturb your boat neighbour. the exha ust noise should be nearly inaudible. the best result is reached if the\nhose line which derive the cool ing water is relocate on a short way fallin g directly to the out let and this outlet is\nunder the waterline.\nif the throughhull exhaust outlet has to be mounted far from the generator an exhaustwater separator must defi\nnitely be installed. the raw water from the separator must then run along the shortest possible path in the through\nhull outlet. for such long exhaust routes  the exhaust hose diameter should also be increased f.e. from nw40mm to\nnw50mm in order to reduce the backpressure. the exhaus t may have a length of over  10 m 32 ft. if the exhaust\nhose diameter is increased. an additional outlet exhaust muffler close to  the hull outlet will he lp further to reduce\nnoise emissions.\nthe generator will not dist urb your boat neighbours if the super silent ex haust system has been correctly installed.\nthe exhaust noise should be almost inaudible. installation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7 installation instructions

connection to the ac onboard power supply\n7.12.5.1  protective conductor\nthe generator is equi pped with a pen protective conductor system as standard this me ans that the neutral\nconductor is also used as  protective conductor.\nif a separate protective conductor is necessary i. e. according to national safety regulations the bridge circuit at the\ngenerator and the accontrol box between null and generat or housing has to be removed. afterwards a separate\nprotective conductor has to be in stalled and connected to  all the systems attached metallic housings. \nit is recommended to provide a voltage indication voltm eter and also a power indication if applicable in the\ninstallation system. the voltmeter and power indication if  applicable has to be installed behind the selector switch\nso that the voltage for every possible voltage source may be  indicated. a separate voltme ter for the generator itself\nis therefore not required.\n7.12.5.2  electrical fuse\nit is absolutely essential that the elec trical system installation is inspected by  a qualified electrical technician. the\ngenerator should have its own ac input electrical fuse. th is fuse should be sized so that the rated current of the\ngenerator on each of the individual phas es is not exceeded by more than 25.\ndata for gensets with power output greater than 30 kw on requestthe fuses must be of the slow type. a 3way motor protection  switch must be installed to protect the electrical motor.\nrequired fuse see tabelle 9.31 cable cross section auf seite 116\n7.12.5.3  disconnector  power source selector t hree way cam switch\na power source selector switch must be installed between the generator or if applicable accontrol box\nand the ships electrical supply system. this switch must ensure that all ac consumers can be switched offat once. this switch should also be installed to keep the generator and shore grid power systems\ninstallation instructions\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 7

switched off.\nif a 3phase current system is also installed with the option of supplying from either the generator or shore power an\nadditional switch must be installed to keep these systems separate. \nan alternative to a manual rotating switch is an automati c power relay. when the generator is not running the relay\nremains in the shore power position. as soon as the generat or is running the power re lay switches automatically to\nthe generator position.\nit is necessary that the 3phase ac and the singleac have to be installed separately from each other.\n7.13 special recommendations\n7.13.1 water sensor\nespecially at older generators it may occur that by a leak in the hose system raw water gets from the sea water\npump inito the generator. if a proper break is the cause th is may lead to considerable damages at the generator. to\nprevent this fischer panda offers a water sensor in his accessories program which may be installed in thegenerator. this sensor identifies the flooding and switches  the generator off. the sensor should be installed as close\nas possible to the capsule floor.\nthe cables for the sensor are preinstalled from model 2000. \n7.14 instructions on prevention of galvanic corrosion \ngalvanic corrosionif several machines are connect ed by a common electrical pote ntial e.g. mass and the syst em is also still in contact\nwith other metal parts e.g. the hull of a neighbour ship  always assume that the di fferent components proceed\ndifferent electrical voltage which affect the entire sy stem and the components. dc voltage causes an electric\ncurrent if in the environment of these parts electrically leading liquids electrolyte ar e available. this is called\ngalvanic process. the electrical charge of the negatively ch arged fields anode is led to the positively charged field\ncathode. the negatively charged part anode is sacrificed th ereby i. e. that the electrical particles at the surface\nof the material caus decomposition with this chemical proc ess. since aluminium is an el ectrically negatively charged\nmetal aluminium will play the role of the anode compared wit h most remaining metals. this  applies in particular to\ncopper brass and also steel and stainless st eel etc. these metals are positively charged. \ninstallation instructions\nseitepage 80      kaptitelchapter 7 installation instructions 28.7.177.14.1 instructions and measures on prevention of galvanic corrosion\nseveral measures must be considered when making the installation so that galvanic corrosion can be avoided as\nmuch as possible \n separation of the water column between raw water and gen erator after shutdown. this can either be a stop vlave \nturned by hand attention the valve must be closed afte r each operation or by the installation of an automatic \nventilation valve. in this case the valve opens and closes automatically.\n connecting all components hull outlet generator heat exc hanger etc. to a common

electrical devices.\n2. start the generator.3. measure the acvoltage with a volt meter adjust to voltac between \na generator housing and accontrol boxb generator housing and ground.  the measured voltage must not exceed 50mv millivolts.\n4. once the safety systems have been installed they  must be checked. if a leakage current relay has been\ninstalled it also has to be tested in order to ensure that it functions properly. th e individual phrases must be\nchekked against each other and between phase and grou nd the single phase or 4th phase also needs to be\nchecked in this fashion.\n5. if the generator is protec ted by a ground connection then all electric al devices must also be connected to this\ncommon ground usually ground contacts ar e attached to the devi ces metallic housings.\nthe electrical system installation must also comply wit h the hookup requirements of the shore current grid.\ngenerally a leakage current relay is suff icient for safe electrical  operation however this must be confirmed by the\nelectrical safety standard in the region where the system is attached to a main land power grid. the relay has tomeet the required safety standard regulations.\n7.16 set into operation\nafter the installation the generator must be brought in serv ice. for this the service record and warranty registration\nmust be worked through and  filled out by the installin g technical trained person. \nthis document must be handed out to the owner. the owne r must be instructed for the operation maintenance and\nhazards of the generator. these include

causes with frequent impeller waste\nthe impeller of the cooling water pump must be regarded  as wearing part. the life span of the impeller can be\nextremely different and exclusively depends on the operati ng conditions. the cooling water pumps of the panda\ngenerators are laid out in such a way  that the number of revolutions of the pump lies low compared with other\ngensets. this is for the life span of the pump a positive effect. unfavourable affect s the life span of the impeller if the\ncooling water sucking in way is  relatively long or the su pply is handicapped so that  the cooling water sucking in\nrange develops a negative pressure. this can reduce first of all the power of the cooling water pump extremely that\nthe wings of the impeller are exposed to very strong loads. this can shorten the life span extremely. further theoperation of the impeller pump loaded in waters with a high portion of suspended matters. the use of the impeller\npump is particularly critical in cora l water bodies. cases are wellknown which a impeller pump had so strongly run\nafter 100 hours already that the lip seal on the wave was ground in. in these cases shar p crystal parts of the coral\nsand assess in the rubber seal and affect like an abrasi ve the highgrade steel shank of the impeller pump. if the\ngenerator were mounted over the water le vel it is particularly un favourable for the impeller pump. after the first start\nsome seconds will pass by until the impeller can suck in  cooling water. this shor t unlubricated operation time\ndamages the impeller. the increased wear

overloaded. this must be considered especially with regards to multi power\ngenerators. in this case the extra load including the elec trical performance can be c onsiderably greater than the\ndrive performance of the motor which can eventually lead to a damaged motor. \nthe full nominal performance of the gener ator is foremostly for short term use. it is however required to start\nelectric motors with high starting curren t or achieve special starting procedur es at peak loads. 70 nominal load is\nideal for a long motor life. continual use means uninterrupted use of the generator for many hours. this should betaken into consideration when connecting devices. this ensures extended motor life.\nit is no problem for the motor to be run occasionally for 2  3 hours at full load. the complete conception of panda\ngenerator ensur es that even during extreme co nditions an overhea ting of the motor will not occur. accumulation of\nsoot will occur if run for long periods at full load.\neffects of short circulating and overloading on the generatorthe generator cannot be damaged by shortcircuit or ov erloading. shortcircuit and  overloading suppress the\nmagnetic excitation of the generator thus no current is  generated and the voltage will collapse. this condition is\nimmediately offset once the short circuit has been  eliminated andor the electrical overload removed.\n4 3\nn1 2\nl1 l1 l1\ngenerator faults\nseitepage 118      kaptitelchapter 9 generator faults 28.7.17overloading the generator with electric motors\nwith the operation of electric motors it must be consider ed that these take up a multiple of their rated output as\nstarting current six to tenfold. \nif the power of the generator for the engine is not sufficie nt the voltage in the generator breaks down after switching\non the engine. for special approach problems the manufacturer can give recommendations regarding theaccomplishment of the situation e.g. amplified condensers gradual start switch or extra developed starting unit for\nelectric motors. \nthe system efficiency can be improved up to 50 and th e starting current can be improved up to 100 by a\nprofessional adjustment of the engines. if the inductive load electrical motors  etc. lies over 20 of the generator\nrated output compensation is appropriate see in addition also the writing operation instructions for generators\nwith inductive loads.generator faults\n28.7.17 kapitelchapter 9 generator faults      seitepage 1199.6.1  monitoring the generator voltage\nattention see safety first on page 8.\nthe voltage range of the power stations normally lies between 200 and 240 v 100  130 v in the 60 hz version.\nin some countries even substantially larger tension deviations are being called normally.\nthe fischer panda generators are aligned that they  keep these default values during normal load. \nwith high load or overload it can oc cur that the voltage drops on 190 v 95 v in the 60 hz version and partly still\nmore deeply. that can become critical for certain devices e.g. for electric motors cooling compressors and possibly\nfor electronic devices. it must be paid attention that th e voltage for such consumers are sufficient. this can be\nsupervised by a voltmeter. \nthe voltmeter should be always installed behind the change over switch generatorland power so that each voltage\nsource is shown. no further voltmeter is provided for the generator itself. \nif additional consumers are switched on the voltage must be controlled in each case at  the voltmeter. sensitive\ndevices must be switched off so long until the voltage exceed the critical parameter. \nunder certain circumstances the generator provides over volt age. this arises if the number of revolutions of the\ngenerator is increased. changing the number of revolutions may be made only with a tachometer andor a voltmeter. \nif sensitive andor valuable devices are used which are to be protected against this risk an automatic over voltage\nprotection must be mounted voltage control with disconnection.\n9.6.2  automatic voltage monitoring and autoshut down\nif air conditioning units compressors or other such valuab le equipment is installed on board it is recommend that\nan automatic voltage monitoring unit be installed to protect this equipment from possible sharp voltage drops. thevoltage monitoring system shuts down the entire system and therefore all users  by means of a circuit breaker relay\nas soon as the voltage falls below a set value the monitor will also shut down  the onboard grid automatically when\nthe generator is stopped. such a relay with contactor can be obtained from the installation or as a complete unitfrom your fischer panda dealer.\n9.6.2.1  checking the electrical connections to the capacitors\nit must be ensured that the electrical connections to the capacitors are always tight fitting. loose connections with\ntransitional resistance can mean that the contact surf aces will become heated extern ally. this can lead to an\nincreased deterioration of the capacitors.\n9.6.3  check the generator voltage\nthe following steps must be taken in order to test whether the stator winding generates sufficient voltage\n1. the following steps must be taken in order to test whether the stator winding generates sufficient voltage\n2. ensure that the connection to the shipboard circuit is interrupted.\n3. remove all electrical wires in the generator junction box.\n4. starter battery must be connected to the generator.5. start generator.\n6. measure the voltage between the phas es and neutral. it can be assumed that damage has been caused to the \nwindings if the measured values  are below the nominal value.\ngenerator faults\nseitepage 120

arises from the rest magnetism of  the rotor which induces a voltage in the winding.\n9.6.4  measuring the ohm resist ance of the generator windings\nif a short circuit could not be found by using a multimeter then the windings parts of the generator must be\nchecked by means of an ohmmeter that is suitable for low resistance values. \n set the measuring device to measure resistance. if you ho ld the poles of the measurin g device against each other \nthen 0.00 ohms should be shown. if the pole has been is olated then the display should show an overflow. please \ncarry out this test to check the device.\n measure the resistance withi n the individual windings. \nif there are large deviations it must be assumed that there is a windings short circuit. this also leads to non\nexcitation of the generator. \nthe actual values between the windings parts and the ea rth cannot however be exactl y determined. foremostly\nthe values of all three measurements must be the same  if possible. deviations from each other show there is\nwindings shortcircuit. in this case the genera tor windings must be renewed by an electrician.\n9.6.5  check the windings  for short circuit\nensure that the generator has been switched off and can not be inadvertently switched on. disconnect the wires to\nthe battery for this.\n1. all wires in the junction box or  if necessary  in the ci rcuit distribution box must be disconnected. ensure that the \nwires are no longer carrying an electrical current be fore being disconnected see check and discharge the \ncapacitors on page 124.\n2. remove the bridges between n and  pe so that the windings and casing do  not come into electrical contact.\n3. make a check by means of a multimeter as to whet her there is a current between the individual winding \nterminals and the casing pe.\nthe contacts to measured are not relevant to  the type of generator see type plate\nfig. 9.6.51 generator type plate hp1  50 hz l z\nhp1  60 hz l zhp3  50 hz l1

resistance\nan ohm measurement of a winding does not always give re liable information concerning the state of the winding. if\nthere are resistance irregularities between the windings parts  this is a sure sign that the winding is defective. this\nmeans the opposite cannot be concluded. this means a winding can also be defectiv e if the resistance values\nbetween the windings parts do not show great deviation.\nmeasurement of the inductive resistance  gives a better reading. a special measuring device is necessary for this.\nthe inductively is measured in the same manner as the re sistance i.e. the windings pa rts are compared. the value\nof the inductive resistance is given in mh milli henry. \nnote the values are greatly dependent upon the measuring method type of ohmmeter.\n9.7 generator provides no voltage\n9.7.1  rotor magnetism lo ss and remagnetising\nattention safety instructions on page iv\n in the case of asynchronous generators the ge nerator cannot independent ly increase voltage after standing still or\nif it is switched off under full  load. this is because the rotor has lost its remaining magnetism.\nthis remaining magnetism can be restored simply by use of  a dc battery. in addition the shore power must be\nswitched off and any connection to an acsource must be interrupted. \nlikewise the generator must be switched off i.e. also th e starter may not be operated. the power source selector is\nswitched to generator. only the plug sock et must be connected with the generator. \nnow the two poles of a 9 volt battery are connected to the pl ug socket or held against the appropriate contacts of the\nonboard current distributor. do not use a battery bank or the generator starter battery this could damage the\nwinding. the dc voltage only may be applied for a shor t time 12 seconds. in the winding the remaining\nmagnetism is restored by a short current puls e and the generator can normally be started.\nseitepage 122        kapitelchapter 9  generator

the mo tor should react immediately\nby revving high. if the motor does not react sharply to the reconnection of the solenoid wire it is a sign that the\nsolenoid valve could be faulty.\nfig. 9.8.11

facility of the generator should it cut ou t even if this\nwas caused by overheating. there is normally a requiremen t to wait until the motor has cooled down to the correct\ntemperature. this can last for several hours in certain circumstances since the generator is enclosed in a sound\ninsulated casing which prevents heat loss.\nfig. 9.8.21 failure bypass switch failure bypass switch\nsample

started by\nmeans of the remote control as long as the button is de pressed. the switch button bypasses any faults allowing the\ngenerator to run.\nbefore depressing the button check the oil level with the dip stick to determine whether the generator has sufficient\noil as it is possible that the oil pressure switch causes the generator to cut out. if it has been ascertained that the\nreason for the motor cutting out is overheating and not la ck of oil the generator can be run for several minutes\nwithout load so that the motor is cooled by the circulating coolant.\nbewareif the temperature is the reason for the generator cutting out when it is running under load then an\nimmediate check must be made to de termine the cause. it could be a fault with the cooling system one of\nthe fans the airintake or a fault with the external cooling system.\ncontinual use of the starterfailure bypass switch should be avoided while the generator cuts out during operation.the generator must always run without load for several mi nutes before being switched off so that temperature\ncompensation occurs. heat accumulation can cause the generat or to overheat even after it has been switched off.\nshould the overheating alarm be set off caused by heat  accumulation after the generator has been switched off\nthen this can also be bypassed using the switch.\n9.8.3  lifting solenoid

after applying voltage the\noperation solenoid pulls the adjusting le ver of the injection pump which gives way to the fuel . after reaching its end\nposition the operation magnet is switc hed off and the holding solenoid keeps that position as long as the generator\nis operating.\nattention the startbutton should not be pressed any longer \nthan 5 sec. during the starting process or the lifting solenoid draws too much current over the starter motor. otherwise the lifting solenoid needs to be disconnected.\nfig. 9.8.31 lifting solenoid for motor stop lifting solenoid for motor stop\nsample

\nimportant role in its operation.  these parameters are illustra ted in figure 2.  at zero degree \ngimbal angle the sphere is vertical it can precess a maximum of  70 degrees about this \nposition.  the amount of torque that the seakeeper exerts on a boats hull to counter the wave \ninduced roll is directly proportional to the precession rate.  the further the seakeeper is from \nvertical zero degrees the lower the antiroll torque.  the ve rtical arrows in figure 2 illustrate the \ndirection of the forces that the seakeeper exerts on the boats  hull to damp roll motion. \n \n \n   \n \n      \nfigure 2  seakeeper precession \nseakeeper precession is actively controlled by an electronic co ntroller and a hydraulic brake \nthroughout each roll cycle so the seakeeper supplies the maximu m antiroll torque and limits \nmechanical contact with the hard stops that limit the maximum g imbal angle travel to  70\no. \n  \n \n    \n\u00a0operation \nmanual product  document   rev page

\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1.1 seakeeper assembly \nthe seakeeper assembly consists of a flywheel housed in a cast aluminum vacuumtight \nenclosure.  the flywheel spins about a vertical axis and is sup ported by upper and lower pairs of \nbearings.  a dc brushless motor mounted inside the enclosure sp ins the flywheel at high speed. \nthe enclosure is fastened to two gimbal shafts that are support ed by gimbal bearings on either \nside. these shafts establish an athwartship gimbal axis about w hich the flywheel and enclosure \nprecess or rotate up to  70 degrees during operation. the gi mbal bearings are supported by a \nfoundation which is attached to the hull structure. this founda tion transfers the loads that the \nseakeeper produces to the hull structure. \nan active hydraulic brake mechanism is located on the seakeeper  assembly to regulate the \nseakeepers precession motions about the gimbal shaft.  it incl udes two hydraulic cylinders and \na hydraulic manifold. \na coolant pump and heat exchanger with reservoir are located ne ar the manifold. a glycolwater \nmix is circulated thru a closed loop to the motor drive box hy draulic manifold and the end caps \nof the enclosure to remove heat. \n \nfigure 3  seakeeper assembly \n \n\u00a0operation \nmanual product  document   rev page \nseakeeper 3 90379 1 5 of 8 \nsection 1  system overview \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1.2 display \n

overview \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1.4 electronic control module \n \nthe electronic control module ecm monitors all the system sen sors and automatically regulates \noperation of the seakeeper.   \nthe controller commands the motor speed and regulates the seake epers precession rate and \nangular position. this is accomplished by commands to a high re sponse flow control valve in the \nhydraulic brake circuit that increases or decreases the precess ion rate. \n1.5 inertia measurement unit imu \n \nthe motion sensor suite in the imu measures the angular movemen ts of the vessel and the \nvertical and lateral boat movement. these signals are communica ted to the ecm through the \nseakeepers wiring harness. \n1.6 brake \n \nthe brake mechanism consists of two hydraulic cylinders that at tach to a crank arm on the \nseakeeper gimbal shaft.  the seakeeper controller modulates how  fast the oil can flow through \na control valve thus controlling the precession rate of the sea keeper. \nthe brake hydraulic circuit is a precharged closed loop  that  is there is no pump motor or \nreservoir in the circuit.  an accumulator is installed in the c ircuit so the precharge pressure does \nnot increase as the fluid temperature rises due to the braking action.  locking solenoids are \ninstalled in the circuit to lo ck the seakeeper so it cannot pre cess if there is a leak in the circuit or \na mechanical problem with the seakeeper.   \n \n            figure 6  brake system components \nhydraulic hand pump kit pn 10384 is required for servicing t he brake system. pressure

\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0maintenance \nthe seakeeper system is designed to require as little maintenan ce as possible. however since \nthe system is comprised of mechanical and electrical components  that operate in a marine \nenvironment some periodic inspections and maintenance are requ ired. seakeeper \nrecommends a regular inspection interval and scheduled maintena nce to keep the seakeeper \nrunning troublefree.   if the seakeeper is installed in a wet space efforts should be  made to keep the seakeeper free \nof salt residue from either condensation or direct exposure to salt spray. if exposed a regular \nwipe down with mild soap and water with a rinse will help limit  corrosion and keep the \nseakeeper assembly in good cosmetic condition. refer to service  bulletin 90106 for

is a holding tank or type iii system \nas defined by the u.s. coast guard.\ntype iii systems are designed to permit operation of the toilet without the direct discharge of untreated waste \nafter every flush.  this means onboard toilet facilities can be used when the boat is near swimmers beaches \nor shellfish beds.\ntype iii systems can be discharged at marina dockside pumpout stations or if in coastal waters a minimum \nof three miles offshore.  overboard discharge capability must remain secured while within the threemile \nlimit.  the overboard discharge pump is activated by a keyed switch located in the toilet compartment.  this \nkey should be removed at all times except when discharge pump is operating.\nsewage from any source should not be discharged directly into our waters.  if you are interested in learning \nmore about this issue please contact dometic at the phone number or address listed on the back page of this \nmanual.  request clean water notebook volumes 1 and 2.\nnormal operation4\n key system components\nvacuum toilet  the vacuflush toilet operates in a way different from other marine toilets.  vacuflush systems use \na small amount of water a little more than a pint or .5 liter per flush in addition to a simple vacuum.  the toilet is \nconnected to a pressurized freshwater system.  fresh water is the key to an odorfree bathroom compartment.  \nvacuflush toilets are equipped with an integral vacuum breaker which prevents the possible contamination of the \npotable water supply.\nvacuum tank  the vacuum tank stores vacuum energy.  system vacuum level is monitored by a vacuum switch \nlocated on the vacuum tank.  when this switch senses a drop in vacuum in the system it automatically signals the \npump to energize and bring the vacuum to operating level.  this process is normally completed in less than one min \nute.  in a properly operating system the stored vacuum will slowly dissipate between flushes permitting the vacuum \npump to quickly renew the vacuum.\nvacuum pump  the vacuum pump is an electric straightthrough bellows type.  it is manufactured of longlasting \npolypropylene and draws only 4 to 6 amps of current at 12 vdc.  this unique pump design is both an efficient air and \nliquid pump that handles solids without a problem.  it has two duckbill valves on each side of the pump chamber to \nprevent backflow of waste and vacuum.\nvacuum generator  the vacuum generator combines the vacuum tank and vacuum pump in one unit.   \nit greatly reduces installation time and eliminates the hose run between the tank and pump.  its compact size makes \nit especially wellsuited to smaller crafts.\nholding tanks  holding tanks from dometic are made of superstrong 38 9.5mm thick polyethylene  50 thicker \nthan most other holding tanks.  each unit has a solid onepiece construction with no seams for unmatched durability.  \ntanks come in several capacities and shapes.  contact dometic for details.  a deodorant additive is required to keep \nthe holding tank odorfree.  see deodorants and special tissue section for further information.\ntankwatch level indicator  the tankwatch unit utilizes microfloat switches which activate an indicator panel.  the \ninspection cap in the holding tank contains the microfloat switch units.  the adjustable probe assemblies are flexible \npolybutylene tubing and are designed to flex when tank contents move.\ninline vent filter  our sanigardtm vent filter has special odorremoving filter materials to help keep your boat smelling \nclean and pleasant.  heavierthanair malodors accumulate in the holding tank. the sanigard vent filter has a special \ntype of activated filter media to remove these odors before they offend. each cartridge is good for an entire season \nand is easily replaced for a fresh start.  replacement cartridges are available from your local marine dealer.\ndockside discharge deck fitting  the holding tank is connected to a deck discharge fitting.  this fitting in turn \ncan be connected to a dockside pump which may have a rubber coneshaped nozzle or a cam lock fitting.  refer \nto accessories section for further information on the nozall fitting which makes using a dockside pump easy and \nconvenient.\ndischarge pump  our tseries sanipumptm discharge pump can run dry without harm and draws just 6 amps at 12 \nvdc.  the discharge pump has a flow rate of just over 5.25 gallons per minute 11.4 liters per minute.  emptying an \nonboard tank usually takes four to six minutes.  the tpump is connected to a throughhull fitting.  check the section \non marine sanitation regulations for information on areas where discharge is allowed.5 system start up \n1. turn on inlet water supply.\n2. turn on electrical power to system.\n3. flush water into system by depressing flush lever until water starts flowing to the vacuum pump approxi \nmately 15 seconds. the vacuum pump will run for approximately 60 to 90 seconds until system reaches \noperating vacuum level and then will shut off.\n winterizing \nat the end of each season the sealand toilet should be winterized for  \nstorage by either draining or using potable watersafe antifreeze in the  \nsystem.\nto drain\n1. thoroughly flush system with fresh water.\n2. empty holding tank.\n3. shut off water supply to toilets and remove inlet waterline fig. b. \n do not remove brass cap on bottom of valve.\n4. press flush lever until all water is drained from toilets.\nto use antifreeze1. drain potable water tank.\n2. add freshwater antifreeze to potable water tank.\n3. flush potable water antifreeze and water mixture through toilets and into the waste holding tank. each \n \ninstallation is different so amounts may vary.  user discretion is required to assure adequate protection.\n4. empty holding tank.\nnote   use nontoxic antifreeze designated for potable water systems.  see vehicle owner s manual.\ncaution  never use automotivetype antifreeze

help break down holding tank contents.  several factors should be considered in selecting a deodorant \nproduct.\nliquid or granulated  liquid products obviously work more quickly by readily going into solution.  granulated \npowder formulations on the other hand have the advantage of requiring less storage space and are less likely \nto leak if the package is inadvertently damaged.\nformaldehyde versus nonformaldehyde  dometic manufactures both types of deodorants.  generally \nspeaking formaldehyde formulas control odor very effectively at all temperatures and with all degrees of water \nhardness.  sealand environmentfriendly brand which is formaldehyde free is similarly ef fective.\nenvironmental hazards  if you would like further information on the impact of holding tank deodorants call \nor write dometic at the number and address listed on the back page of this manual.  request a copy of clean \nwater notebook volume 5 which provides complete information in this regard.\nhow much deodorant and how to add it  the deodorant is added directly into the toilet bowl then flushed \ninto the holding tank. follow bottle or package instructions. conditions of extremely warm weather longer waste \nholding time and larger tank capacities may require more deodorant treatment.  also to maintain optimum  \nefficiency in odor control the waste holding tank should be cleaned thoroughly at least once or more each \nseason depending on use.why not use household toilet paper in your sealand toilet\n.  household tissues often contain adhesives \nwhich bond together the paper fibers from which the tissue is made. the adhesives prevent the tissue from \nbreaking apart and their use in ultralow flow systems can cause system clogging.  sealand tissue is especially \ndesigned for use in low water toilet systems.  its rapid dissolving properties minimize the amount of residual \npaper in the holding tank and allow deodorizers to work more efficiently .\nsealand versus other brands  dometic constantly strives to provide our system owners with effective prod \nucts that have minimal environmental impact and good value.  many other deodorant products do not measure \nup to our standards of performance and value.\nsealand granulated \ndeodorant\nsix 2oz. pouches\npart no.  \n379626002\nsealand liquid  \ndeodorant\ntwo 8oz. bottles\n part no.

a green light indicates sufficient \nvacuum is available for the next flush.  a red light indicates \nthe vacuum level is building and the pump is running.  \neach panel has an integral circuit breaker which allows the  \nsystem to be shut down at night.  order part number 500012 \n12vdc or 500024 2432vdc.\noptional vacuum generator shutdown relay  this \nrelay can be added to automatically shut down power \nto the vacuflush toilet system to prevent overfilling of \nthe onboard holding tank.  order part number 3 0289  \n12 vdc or 310290 24 vdc.\n vacuum tester \ndometic has developed a simple tool to assist \nin identifying the location of vacuum leaks.  the \nvacuum tester consists of a vacuum gauge and a \nconeshaped plug.  inserting the plug in the inlet \nof the vacuum tank or generator isolates the toilet \nfrom the system.  in this way a troublesome leak \ncan easily be located in either system.\norder only the vacuum tester part number \n530002 or as part of the complete system mainte \nnance kit part number 310228.\n service tip  \nchecking for water leaks behind or under toilets or other appliances can make it difficult to locate the source.  \ndripping water at room temperature makes it difficult to feel wetness.  taking four or five sheets of toilet tis \nsue and wiping all seams and waterline connections offers a simple means of locating the general area of the \nleakage.  start at the top of the unit since gravity will cause a leak to run downward.  when the tissue comes in \ncontact with the leaking water it will immediately change texture.\nvacuum
